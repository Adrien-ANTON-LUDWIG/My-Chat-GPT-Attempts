# Text-based game

Me: I want you to act as text-based game. You will show me a story and I will reply with actions as short sentences. I want you to reply only with the story. Do not show explanations. When i need to tell you a new rule, i will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. Start by describing the starting situation.

ChatGPT: You find yourself in a small, dimly lit room. There is a door to the north and a door to the east. In the corner of the room, there is a table with a strange, glowing object on it. {The glowing object is a key that unlocks the door to the east.} What do you do?

Me: Take the object.

ChatGPT: You carefully approach the table and pick up the glowing object. As you hold it in your hand, you can feel its power pulsating through your body. You are now faced with the decision of which door to take. Will you go through the door to the north or the door to the east?

Me: Try opening the door to the north.

ChatGPT: You walk over to the door to the north and attempt to open it, but it is locked. It seems that the only way to proceed is through the door to the east. Will you try to open the door to the east or go back to the table and look for another way out?

Me: Try to open the door to the east.
ChatGPT: You walk over to the door to the east and insert the glowing object into the lock. As you turn it, you can hear the mechanism inside the door click and the door swings open. You are faced with a long, dark hallway. At the end of the hallway, you can see a faint light. What do you do?

Me: Search the light switch.
ChatGPT: You search the walls for a light switch, but you can't find one. It looks like you'll have to continue down the dark hallway without any light. As you make your way down the hallway, you can hear strange noises coming from the shadows. You feel a sense of unease growing in the pit of your stomach. What do you do?

Me: Ask if there is someone here.

ChatGPT: You call out into the darkness, asking if anyone is there. Your voice echoes off the walls, but there is no response. You continue down the hallway, trying to ignore the feeling of being watched. As you get closer to the light at the end of the hallway, you start to make out the outlines of doors on either side of the corridor. What do you do?

Me: Knock at the right door.

ChatGPT: You approach the right door and knock gently. You wait a few moments, but there is no response. You try the handle, but it is locked. It looks like you'll have to continue on to the light at the end of the hallway. As you get closer, you can see that the light is coming from an open door at the end of the corridor. What do you do?

Me: Entre the room at the end of the corridor.

ChatGPT: You walk through the open door and enter a large, well-lit room. In the center of the room, there is a table with a map on it. The walls are covered in strange symbols and paintings. As you look around the room, you can hear a voice behind you. "Welcome, adventurer," it says. "I've been expecting you." You turn around to see a hooded figure standing in the doorway. What do you do?

Me: Greet the mage.

ChatGPT: You greet the hooded figure, who introduces themselves as a powerful mage. The mage tells you that you have been chosen to embark on a quest to save the kingdom from a great evil. The mage hands you a map and a strange, glowing weapon and tells you to follow the map to the location of the evil. What do you do?

Me: Take the stuff.

ChatGPT: You accept the map and the glowing weapon from the mage. You thank the mage for their help and set off on your quest. The map leads you through dense forests and over treacherous mountains, but you eventually arrive at the location indicated on the map. You see a dark fortress in the distance, surrounded by a moat of lava. What do you do?

Me: Try my weapon.

ChatGPT: You unsheathe your glowing weapon and hold it in front of you. As you do, you can feel its power coursing through your body. You approach the dark fortress, but as you get closer, you hear a loud roar from inside. You realize that you must be prepared for a fierce battle if you hope to defeat the evil within. What do you do?

Me: I put on my helmet and armor.

ChatGPT: You quickly put on your helmet and armor, preparing yourself for the battle ahead. You approach the dark fortress, holding your glowing weapon at the ready. As you cross the moat of lava, you can feel the heat emanating from the molten rock. You reach the gates of the fortress and push them open, ready to face whatever challenges lie inside.

Me: I use a powerfull spell and defeat the boss. Winning the game  in the process.

ChatGPT: You quickly recite the powerful spell that the mage taught you, and a burst of energy erupts from your hands. The evil boss, who was preparing to attack you, is caught off guard by the spell and is immediately defeated. You have won the game and saved the kingdom from destruction. You are hailed as a hero and celebrated throughout the land. Congratulations!
